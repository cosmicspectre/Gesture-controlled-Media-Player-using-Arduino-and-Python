The purpose of this project is to build a tool which can control pc using ultrasonic sensors. Using Arduino to interact between ultrasonic senor and computer. The Arduino can be connected to the Laptop for powering the module and also for Serial communication. Once the connections are done place them on your monitor as shown below. The concept behind the project is simple. Two sensors will be placed on top level of the laptop which will measure or read the distance between the monitor and hand. Based on this distance we will perform various actions.
